# Proof of Synergy (PoSy) Consensus Mechanism Specification

## 1. Introduction

The Proof of Synergy (PoSy) consensus mechanism is designed to prioritize collaboration over competition by leveraging dynamic contribution evaluation, heterogeneous resource utilization, and task-based clustering. This specification outlines the technical implementation details of PoSy for the Synergy Network.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Synergy Task Pools

#### 2.1.1 Task Pool Structure
```
TaskPool {
    id: UUID,
    taskType: Enum(TRANSACTION_VALIDATION, DATA_PROCESSING, FILE_STORAGE),
    priority: Integer,
    tasks: Array<Task>,
    requirements: ResourceRequirements,
    creationTimestamp: Timestamp,
    expirationTimestamp: Timestamp
}

Task {
    id: UUID,
    data: Bytes,
    complexity: Float,
    reward: Integer,
    status: Enum(PENDING, ASSIGNED, COMPLETED, VERIFIED, FAILED),
    assignedCluster: UUID,
    result: Bytes,
    deadline: Timestamp
}

ResourceRequirements {
    minCPU: Integer,
    minMemory: Integer,
    minStorage: Integer,
    minBandwidth: Integer,
    gpuRequired: Boolean,
    specialHardware: Array<String>
}
```

#### 2.1.2 Task Pool Management
- **Creation**: Task pools are created by the network or by users submitting batches of similar tasks
- **Prioritization**: Tasks are prioritized based on fee, age, and system needs
- **Expiration**: Tasks expire after a predefined period if not processed
- **Monitoring**: The system monitors task pool size and adjusts parameters to maintain optimal throughput

### 2.2 Validator Clusters

#### 2.2.1 Cluster Structure
```
Cluster {
    id: UUID,
    validators: Array<ValidatorInfo>,
    assignedTasks: Array<Task>,
    formationTimestamp: Timestamp,
    reshuffleTimestamp: Timestamp,
    status: Enum(FORMING, ACTIVE, DISSOLVING),
    performance: ClusterPerformance
}

ValidatorInfo {
    nodeId: String,
    publicKey: String,
    resources: ResourceCapabilities,
    synergyPoints: Integer,
    availability: Float,
    lastActiveTimestamp: Timestamp
}

ResourceCapabilities {
    cpu: Integer,
    memory: Integer,
    storage: Integer,
    bandwidth: Integer,
    gpu: Boolean,
    specialHardware: Array<String>
}

ClusterPerformance {
    tasksCompleted: Integer,
    tasksVerified: Integer,
    tasksFailed: Integer,
    averageCompletionTime: Float,
    rewardEarned: Integer
}
```

#### 2.2.2 Cluster Formation Algorithm
1. Select a random subset of available validators
2. Ensure diversity of resources within the cluster
3. Verify no validators share network proximity (anti-collusion)
4. Assign a unique cluster ID
5. Initialize cluster performance metrics

#### 2.2.3 Cluster Reshuffling
- Clusters are reshuffled every 10,000 blocks
- Reshuffling algorithm ensures no validator remains in the same cluster for consecutive periods
- Emergency reshuffling triggered if malicious behavior is detected

### 2.3 Synergy Points System

#### 2.3.1 Points Calculation
```
SynergyPoints = TaskComplexity * CompletionEfficiency * ConsistencyFactor

Where:
- TaskComplexity: Predefined value based on computational requirements
- CompletionEfficiency: (BaselineTime / ActualCompletionTime), capped at 2.0
- ConsistencyFactor: (1 + (ConsecutiveSuccessfulTasks / 100)), capped at 1.5
```

#### 2.3.2 Points Decay
```
DecayedPoints = CurrentPoints * (1 - DecayRate)^TimePeriods

Where:
- DecayRate: 0.05 (5% per epoch)
- TimePeriods: Number of epochs since last activity
```

#### 2.3.3 Points Distribution
- 70% of points awarded to individual validators based on their contribution
- 30% of points awarded equally to all cluster members (collaboration bonus)

### 2.4 PBFT Consensus Implementation

#### 2.4.1 Consensus Phases
1. **Pre-prepare**: Primary validator proposes task results
2. **Prepare**: Validators broadcast prepare messages if they agree with the proposal
3. **Commit**: Validators broadcast commit messages if they received 2f+1 prepare messages
4. **Reply**: Result is considered final when 2f+1 commit messages are received

#### 2.4.2 View Change Protocol
- Triggered if primary validator fails to propose or behaves maliciously
- New primary selected based on deterministic rotation
- View change messages collected and verified
- New view established when sufficient view change messages received

## 3. Consensus Process Flow

### 3.1 Task Assignment
1. Task Allocator selects appropriate tasks for available clusters based on resource matching
2. Selected tasks are assigned to clusters with matching capabilities
3. Cluster receives task assignment and distributes to members
4. Validators acknowledge receipt and begin processing

### 3.2 Task Execution
1. Each validator in the cluster independently executes the assigned task
2. Results are shared within the cluster
3. PBFT consensus is used to agree on the correct result
4. Finalized result is submitted to the network

### 3.3 Result Verification
1. Multiple clusters may verify the same task for critical operations
2. Verification clusters compare their results with the execution cluster
3. Results are confirmed when a threshold of verification clusters agree
4. Disagreements trigger additional verification or task reassignment

### 3.4 Reward Distribution
1. Synergy Points are calculated based on task complexity and performance
2. Points are distributed to validators according to contribution
3. Collaboration bonus is awarded to all cluster members
4. SYN token rewards are distributed proportionally to Synergy Points

## 4. Security Mechanisms

### 4.1 Sybil Attack Prevention
- Minimum stake requirement for validators
- Resource verification during validator registration
- Reputation system based on historical performance
- Cluster diversity requirements

### 4.2 Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- PBFT consensus ensures correct operation with up to f Byzantine nodes where n = 3f+1
- Cluster size minimum of 7 validators (tolerates 2 Byzantine nodes)
- Cross-cluster verification for critical tasks
- Reputation penalties for detected Byzantine behavior

### 4.3 Collusion Prevention
- Random cluster formation
- Regular reshuffling
- Network proximity analysis to prevent related validators in same cluster
- Reward distribution that incentivizes honest behavior

## 5. Performance Optimization

### 5.1 Task Parallelization
- Different clusters work on different tasks simultaneously
- Within clusters, validators may parallelize subtasks when possible
- Task dependencies are tracked to optimize scheduling

### 5.2 Resource Optimization
- Tasks are matched to clusters with appropriate resources
- Idle resources are minimized through dynamic task allocation
- Resource monitoring adjusts task complexity based on network capacity

### 5.3 Communication Optimization
- Gossip protocol for efficient message propagation
- Validator proximity considered for cluster formation to reduce latency
- Message aggregation to reduce network overhead
