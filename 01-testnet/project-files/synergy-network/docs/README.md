## About Synergy Network

Synergy Network is a revolutionary blockchain platform that introduces the novel Proof of Synergy consensus mechanism, which prioritizes collaboration over competition. The network features Post-Quantum Cryptography to ensure long-term security against quantum computing threats.

With a total supply of 10 billion SYN tokens, Synergy Network aims to create a sustainable ecosystem for decentralized applications, while providing robust security, scalability, and user-friendly interfaces.

## Key Features

- **Proof of Synergy Consensus**: A collaborative consensus mechanism with validator clusters
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Future-proof security using Dilithium and Kyber algorithms
- **Synergy Points System**: Reputation-based validator scoring mechanism
- **Validator Clusters**: Dynamic grouping of validators for efficient task processing
- **Synergy Naming System (SNS)**: Human-readable addresses and domain names
- **ICO Pre-sale Platform**: Integrated token sale functionality
- **Comprehensive Explorer**: Full visibility into blockchain operations
