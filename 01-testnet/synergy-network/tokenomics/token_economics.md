# Synergy Network Token Economics

## Overview
The Synergy Token (SYN) is the native utility token of the Synergy Network blockchain platform. This document outlines the updated token economics model with a total supply of 10 billion SYN tokens.

## Token Details
- **Name**: Synergy Token
- **Symbol**: SYN
- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000,000 SYN (10 billion)
- **Decimal Places**: 18
- **Token Standard**: Native blockchain token with ERC-20 compatibility

## Token Distribution
The 10 billion SYN tokens will be distributed as follows:

- **Validator Rewards**: 5,000,000,000 SYN (50%)
  - Allocated for rewarding validators participating in the Proof of Synergy consensus
  - Released gradually over time through block rewards
  - Initial annual emission rate: 5% of total supply, decreasing by 0.5% annually

- **Ecosystem Development**: 2,000,000,000 SYN (20%)
  - Allocated for grants, partnerships, and ecosystem growth initiatives
  - Managed by the Synergy DAO
  - Vesting period: 5 years with quarterly unlocks

- **Public Sale**: 1,500,000,000 SYN (15%)
  - Distributed through ICO pre-sale and public sale events
  - ICO pre-sale allocation: 500,000,000 SYN (5% of total supply)
  - Public sale allocation: 1,000,000,000 SYN (10% of total supply)
  - No vesting for public sale tokens

- **Team and Advisors**: 1,000,000,000 SYN (10%)
  - Allocated to founding team, developers, and project advisors
  - Vesting period: 4 years with 1-year cliff and monthly unlocks thereafter

- **Reserve Fund**: 500,000,000 SYN (5%)
  - Strategic reserve for future development and contingencies
  - Controlled by multi-signature wallet requiring 4/7 signatures
  - Any usage requires community governance approval

## Token Utility
The SYN token serves multiple functions within the Synergy Network ecosystem:

1. **Staking**
   - Validators must stake SYN tokens to participate in consensus
   - Minimum stake requirement: 10,000 SYN per validator
   - Slashing penalties for malicious behavior or downtime

2. **Transaction Fees**
   - All network transactions require SYN tokens for gas fees
   - Base fee: 0.002 SYN (adjustable through governance)
   - Fee calculation based on computational resources used

3. **Governance**
   - Token holders can vote on protocol upgrades and parameter changes
   - Voting weight proportional to token holdings
   - Minimum proposal threshold: 1,000,000 SYN (0.01% of total supply)

4. **Synergy Naming System (SNS)**
   - Registration and renewal of human-readable addresses
   - Standard names: 10 SYN per year
   - Premium names: Auction-based pricing with minimum bid of 100 SYN

5. **Task Rewards**
   - Compensation for completing computational tasks in task pools
   - Reward size based on task complexity and Synergy Points earned

## Deflationary Mechanism
To create sustainable tokenomics and potentially increase token value over time:

- 30% of all transaction fees are burned
- 10% of SNS registration fees are burned
- 5% of validator rewards are burned when claimed

This creates a deflationary pressure that partially offsets new token emissions.

## Emission Schedule
- **Initial Circulating Supply**: 1,500,000,000 SYN (15% - public sale allocation)
- **Year 1 Emission**: 500,000,000 SYN (5% of total supply)
- **Maximum Annual Inflation Rate**: 5% (Year 1), decreasing by 0.5% annually
- **Minimum Annual Inflation Rate**: 1% (stabilized after Year 9)

## Token Lockups and Vesting
- **Team and Advisors**: 1-year cliff, then linear vesting over 3 years
- **Ecosystem Development**: Quarterly unlocks over 5 years
- **Validator Rewards**: Released through block rewards, no lockup
- **Public Sale**: No lockup
- **Reserve Fund**: Controlled by governance, no predetermined vesting

## ICO Pre-sale Details
- **Allocation**: 500,000,000 SYN (5% of total supply)
- **Price Tiers**:
  - Private Round: $0.008 per SYN (200,000,000 SYN)
  - Seed Round: $0.012 per SYN (150,000,000 SYN)
  - Public Pre-sale: $0.018 per SYN (150,000,000 SYN)
- **Minimum Purchase**: 500 SYN
- **Maximum Purchase**: 1,000,000 SYN per wallet
- **Payment Methods**: ETH, BTC, USDT, USDC
- **KYC Requirements**: Required for purchases above 10,000 SYN
- **Restricted Regions**: In compliance with applicable regulations

## Governance Control
The token economics model includes a governance mechanism that allows token holders to propose and vote on changes to the economic parameters, including:

- Transaction fee adjustments
- Reward distribution rates
- Inflation/emission schedules
- Reserve fund usage
- Burning mechanisms

Any parameter changes require a successful governance vote with a minimum 66% approval rate and 40% participation threshold.
