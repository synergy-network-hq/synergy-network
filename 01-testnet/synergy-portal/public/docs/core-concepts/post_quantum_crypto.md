**Post-Quantum Cryptography**

---

**1. Overview**

The Synergy Network is built with native support for post-quantum cryptography (PQC), ensuring long-term security against future threats posed by quantum computing. By adopting quantum-resistant algorithms from the outset, Synergy protects all network participants, wallet holders, and smart contracts from potential cryptographic vulnerabilities.

**2. Why Post-Quantum Security Matters**

* Classical cryptographic algorithms (e.g., RSA, ECDSA) are vulnerable to quantum attacks using Shorâ€™s algorithm.
* Quantum computers capable of breaking current cryptography may be realized within the next decade.
* Blockchain systems must proactively adopt quantum-safe mechanisms to ensure forward security.

**3. Cryptographic Standards Used**

**3.1 Digital Signatures**

* **Algorithm**: Dilithium-3 (NIST PQC standard)
* **Usage**: Wallets, transactions, block signing
* **Properties**:

  * Lattice-based cryptography
  * Short keys and signatures
  * High throughput

**3.2 Hybrid Encryption (Planned)**

* **Algorithm**: Kyber (for shared key establishment)
* **Usage**: Optional secure messaging and identity proofs
* **Mode**: Kyber + AES-GCM for hybrid authenticated encryption

---

**4. Address and Key Generation**

* Wallets generate keys using a BIP-39 compatible PQC scheme
* Public keys are hashed using SHA3-256 or BLAKE3
* Encoded using Bech32m format for addresses (e.g., `sYnQ1...`)
* PQC keypair derived deterministically from 24-word seed phrase

**6. Implementation in Synergy Network**

* Signing implemented via Rust and WebAssembly bindings
* Integrated in wallet CLI, GUI, and smart contract execution engine
* RPC calls support Dilithium signature verification
* Key storage is encrypted locally and can be backed up offline

---

**7. Compatibility with External Chains**

* UMA (Universal Meta-Addresses) use PQC internally but can sign on other chains via threshold signature bridges
* Validator clusters act as FROST/TSS signers for Bitcoin and Ethereum interoperability
* Future integrations planned with zk-proofs and encrypted identity attestations

---

**8. Best Practices for Users**

* Always backup your seed phrase securely
* Use CLI or hardware wallet options for critical transactions
* Keep wallet software updated to maintain compatibility with evolving PQC standards

---

**9. Research and Future Enhancements**

* **zkPQC**: Investigate zero-knowledge proof systems that use lattice-based assumptions
* **Post-Quantum Multisig**: Multi-party signing using Dilithium (draft specs under review)
* **Threshold PQC Wallets**: Split signing key across multiple devices for enhanced cold storage

**10. Conclusion**

Synergy Network is among the first blockchain platforms to implement post-quantum cryptography as a foundational feature. By leveraging state-of-the-art PQC algorithms like Dilithium and Kyber, the network ensures that its infrastructure is resilient, future-ready, and secure against quantum-era threats.
