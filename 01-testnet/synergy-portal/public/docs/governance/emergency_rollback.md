**Emergency Rollback and Parameter Changes**

---

**1. Overview**

Synergy Network incorporates a robust emergency governance framework that enables secure rollback of the network and adjustment of key parameters in response to security breaches, smart contract vulnerabilities, validator takeovers, or systemic failures. These mechanisms are designed to preserve decentralization while enabling swift action under DAO oversight.

**2. Emergency Scenarios**

| Scenario                    | Description                                         |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Smart Contract Exploit      | Critical vulnerability in a deployed contract       |
| Validator Cluster Hijack    | Sybil or malicious control over a validator cluster |
| Governance Takeover Attempt | Exploitation of vote delegation or SP boosting      |
| DDoS or Network Instability | Service disruptions threatening block production    |

---

**3. Emergency Pausing via Multi-Sig**

* Requires 3-of-5 (or 5-of-7) signatures from:

  * Core validators
  * Governance Council members
  * Independent security auditors
* Pauses network by:

  * Halting block production
  * Freezing governance proposals
  * Preventing contract interactions

---

**4. Snapshot-Based Rollbacks**

* Regular state snapshots stored for last 7 epochs
* Rollback process:

  1. Emergency vote to approve rollback
  2. Revert chain to most recent clean snapshot
  3. Publish rollback hash and justification
  4. Validators resync using recovery snapshot

---

**5. Hard Fork Escalation**

* Required if rollback is rejected or snapshot is compromised
* Needs 66% validator cluster support + DAO proposal vote
* Triggered via:

```bash
synergy-cli emergency hardfork --reason "DAO Takeover Defense"
```

---

**6. Emergency Referendum Protocol**

* Community-driven emergency voting
* Requires:

  * 10% of active wallets to co-sign referendum
  * 60% approval among all voters to pass
* Proposals can:

  * Freeze governance
  * Slash malicious validators
  * Override prior vote results (only in critical breaches)

---

**7. Governance Parameter Modification**

Key network parameters modifiable via governance:

| Parameter               | Default    | Change Method           |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Base Transaction Fee    | 0.0001 SYN | DAO proposal            |
| Validator Bond Minimum  | 25,000 SYN | Validator cluster + DAO |
| SP Decay Rate           | 10%/epoch  | Governance vote         |
| Voting Quorum Threshold | 30%        | DAO motion              |

---

**8. DAO Auditor Oversight**

* Security and governance auditors review all emergency actions
* Required to publish:

  * Impact summary
  * Recovery roadmap
  * SP impact for affected validators
* Failure to report may trigger auditor replacement vote

---

**9. Security & Legal Compliance**

* Emergency policies align with regulatory frameworks:

  * GDPR for data rollback constraints
  * SEC/AML compliance for DAO fund freezes
* Legal counsel review is logged as part of rollback execution audit

---

**10. Conclusion**

Emergency rollback and parameter change mechanisms are built to defend the integrity of the Synergy Network without compromising decentralization. Through smart contracts, multi-sig safeguards, and DAO-triggered referenda, Synergy ensures it can adapt quickly to threats while maintaining transparency, accountability, and governance legitimacy.
