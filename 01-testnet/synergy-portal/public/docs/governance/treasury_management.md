**Treasury Management**

---

**1. Overview**

The Synergy Network Treasury is a decentralized, on-chain fund allocation system governed by the DAO. It ensures transparent funding of ecosystem development, validator rewards, community initiatives, and emergency reserves. All spending proposals and transactions are subject to governance approval and audit.
