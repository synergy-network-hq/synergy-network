**Governance Model Overview**

---

**1. Overview**

The Synergy Network employs a decentralized, transparent, and performance-weighted governance system. Its governance model is powered by Synergy Score-weighted quadratic voting, validator clusters, and DAO-enforced execution of community proposals. This ensures decisions reflect the will of active, constructive participants.

**2. Governance Layers**

| Layer                 | Role                                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DAO Council           | Highest oversight body for protocol changes and treasury allocations |
| Validator Clusters    | Technical reviewers for proposals; vote on-chain                     |
| General Token Holders | Participate in proposal creation and voting                          |
| Governance Auditors   | Monitor proposal compliance and misconduct                           |

**3. Governance Assets**

* **SYN Token**: Used for governance voting and proposal collateral
* **Synergy Score**: Performance-based multiplier affecting vote weight
* **SNS Names**: Used as voter identity layer and delegate reputation tracker

---

**4. Voting Weight Calculation**

Final vote weight = staked SYN \* quadratic factor \* Synergy Score multiplier

* Synergy Score boosts are earned through:

  * Validator uptime
  * Participation in governance
  * Contribution to codebase or community

---

**5. Proposal Lifecycle (Summary)**

1. **Proposal Submission**

   * Requires minimum stake (e.g., 1,000 SYN) + positive Synergy Score
2. **Endorsement Phase**

   * Must receive 5% endorsement threshold to proceed
3. **Voting Period**

   * 7 days for community + validator cluster voting
4. **Execution**

   * Smart contract executes proposal logic if passed
5. **Post-Review**

   * Auditors validate outcome and record metrics

---

**6. Governance Domains**

* Protocol Upgrades
* Treasury Allocation
* Validator Policy (min stake, cluster rules)
* Parameter Adjustments (fees, rewards, slashing)
* Emergency Rollback Activation

---

**7. Proposal Types**

| Type               | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Upgrade Proposal   | Software version changes                 |
| Funding Proposal   | Allocate DAO funds to a project          |
| Parameter Proposal | Change network or contract variables     |
| Governance Motion  | Elect/recall council members, moderators |

---

**8. Treasury Governance**

* Controlled by DAO
* Allocation breakdowns and expenditures are recorded on-chain
* Monthly audit reports published via Synergy Explorer
* Emergency withdrawals require multi-sig + community vote

---

**9. Participation Incentives**

* Voting earns micro-rewards (if above 75% turnout)
* SP score increases for honest, consistent voting behavior
* Delegation to SNS profiles enhances reputational power

---

**10. Conclusion**

The Synergy governance model balances decentralized power with contribution-based influence. By tying voting weight to both token stake and behavioral metrics, it aligns the protocol’s direction with those who invest effort—not just capital. It’s a dynamic, modular system built for transparency, resilience, and inclusive evolution.
