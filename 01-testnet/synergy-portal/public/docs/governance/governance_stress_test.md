## Governance Stress Test Results

### 1. Overview

This document summarizes the results of a series of governance stress tests conducted on the Synergy Network DAO. The purpose of these tests is to evaluate the resilience, responsiveness, and integrity of the DAOâ€™s voting, proposal, and treasury systems under simulated high-load and adversarial conditions.

---

### 2. Test Objectives

* Measure system response to high proposal submission volumes
* Simulate Sybil and vote-spamming behavior
* Evaluate smart contract execution under simultaneous governance proposals
* Analyze DAO treasury fund allocation under manipulation attempts
* Test validator cluster consensus during emergency governance forks

---

### 3. Test Parameters

* Epoch Duration Simulated: 3 days
* Proposal Volume: 250 proposals
* Participants Simulated: 12,000 wallet addresses (realistic, weighted Synergy Scores)
* Validator Clusters: 48
* Treasury Disbursements Simulated: 93 requests

---

### 4. Summary Metrics

* **Proposal Success Rate:** 14.8% (due to quorum thresholds and fail-safes)
* **Avg Proposal Execution Time:** 12.4 seconds
* **Vote Casting Latency (Avg):** 740 ms
* **DAO Contract Uptime During Stress:** 99.998%
* **Proposal Rejection Due to Sybil Patterns:** 82 (auto-flagged)
* **Cluster Abstentions Under Load:** 6/48 (flagged for review)

---

### 5. Key Findings

#### 5.1 Smart Contract Performance

* No critical failures observed.
* Multithreaded execution and gas optimization ensured proposal queue integrity.

#### 5.2 Governance Exploit Mitigation

* Sybil detection algorithm correctly flagged and nullified influence of 980 spoofed identities.
* Proposal rate limiting and endorsement quorum thresholds prevented spam flooding.

#### 5.3 Cluster Coordination

* Validator clusters maintained BFT quorum with 94% consistency.
* Emergency override triggers correctly froze two proposals attempting unauthorized treasury drains.

#### 5.4 User Behavior Patterns

* Real participants had a 38% average participation rate across all proposals.
* Delegated votes accounted for 62% of all cast votes, with high correlation to Synergy Score rank.

---

### 6. Recommendations

* Implement stricter endorsement requirements for treasury-related proposals.
* Add mandatory cooldown period after 10 failed submissions per wallet.
* Introduce dashboard alerts for cluster-level abstentions or collusion patterns.

---

### 7. Next Steps

* Formal governance proposal to adopt cooldown and stricter endorsement measures.
* Additional simulation with increased validator count (target: 100 clusters).
* Run Layer 2 scaling benchmarks to explore gas-free governance voting.

---

### 8. Audit & Transparency

* Full test logs and simulation configs published in `/tests/governance_stress/`
* Verified by Governance Auditors Council on-chain (Proposal Ref #19)
* Public JSON report: `stress_results_epoch_X.json`

### 9. Conclusion

The Synergy Network DAO governance framework withstood high-pressure simulation conditions with minimal degradation. While some areas for improvement remain, the system proved capable of automated detection, resistance to vote manipulation, and continued operation under adversarial load.
