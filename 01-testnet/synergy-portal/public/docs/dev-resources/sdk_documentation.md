**SDK Documentation**

---

**1. Overview**

The Synergy SDK enables developers to build applications on the Synergy Network using JavaScript, Python, and Rust libraries. These SDKs simplify interaction with smart contracts, wallets, transactions, and governance by abstracting JSON-RPC calls and encoding standards.

---

**2. Available SDKs**

| Language   | Package Name          | Repository                            |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| JavaScript | `@synergy/sdk-js`     | github.com/synergy-network/sdk-js     |
| Python     | `synergy_sdk`         | github.com/synergy-network/sdk-python |
| Rust       | `synergy-sdk` (crate) | crates.io/crates/synergy-sdk          |

---

**3. Installation**

**JavaScript (Node.js)**

```bash
npm install @synergy/sdk-js
```

**Python**

```bash
pip install synergy_sdk
```

**Rust**

```toml
[dependencies]

**4. Core Features**

| Function                 | Description                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Wallet Management        | Create/import PQC wallets, sign transactions   |
| Contract Interaction     | Call smart contracts and submit deploy scripts |
| Staking Operations       | Delegate/undelegate, check rewards             |
| Governance Participation | Submit proposals, cast votes                   |
| SNS and UMA Integration  | Register `.syn` names, link UMA addresses      |

---

**5. Example Usage**

**JavaScript: Sending SYN**

```js
const { Wallet } = require("@synergy/sdk-js");
const wallet = Wallet.fromMnemonic("... seed words ...");
await wallet.send("sYnQ1xyz...", 100.0);
```

**Python: Querying Wallet Balance**

```python
from synergy_sdk.wallet import Wallet
wallet = Wallet.from_mnemonic("... seed ...")
print(wallet.get_balance())
```

**Rust: Calling Smart Contract**

```rust
let client = synergy_sdk::Client::new("https://rpc.synergy-network.io");
let tx = client.contract("0xabc...").method("getValue").call()?;
```

---

**6. Network Configuration**

* Mainnet: `https://rpc.synergy-network.io`
* Testnet: `https://rpc.testnet.synergy-network.io`
* WebSocket: `wss://ws.testnet.synergy-network.io`

Each SDK allows setting custom endpoints for private chains.

---

**7. Error Handling & Logging**

* All SDKs support verbose logging and structured error objects
* Debug mode:

```js
sdk.setLogLevel("debug")
```

```python
sdk.enable_logging(level="DEBUG")
```

---

**8. Security Considerations**

* Wallet keys are stored encrypted (never uploaded)
* PQC (Dilithium) signatures are used for all transactions
* SDKs validate inputs before RPC dispatch

---

**9. Contributions & Support**

* Issues and feature requests: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/synergy-network/sdk-js/issues)
* Community Discord: [https://discord.synergy-network.io](https://discord.synergy-network.io)
* Documentation portal: [https://docs.synergy-network.io/sdk](https://docs.synergy-network.io/sdk)

**10. Conclusion**

The Synergy SDKs make it easy to build post-quantum-secure dApps, bots, tools, and wallet integrations. With official support for JS, Python, and Rust, developers can interact with Synergyâ€™s features safely and efficiently across any ecosystem.
