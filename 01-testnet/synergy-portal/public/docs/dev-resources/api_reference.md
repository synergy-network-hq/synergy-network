**API Reference (JSON-RPC + WebSocket)**

---

**1. Overview**

The Synergy Network exposes a comprehensive JSON-RPC and WebSocket API interface for developers to interact with the blockchain programmatically. These APIs allow for reading chain state, sending transactions, listening to events, and integrating third-party tools or frontends.

**2. Endpoints**

| Type        | URL                                                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| JSON-RPC    | [https://rpc.synergy-network.io](https://rpc.synergy-network.io)                 |
| Testnet RPC | [https://rpc.testnet.synergy-network.io](https://rpc.testnet.synergy-network.io) |
| WebSocket   | wss\://ws.synergy-network.io                                                     |
| Testnet WS  | wss\://ws.testnet.synergy-network.io                                             |

**3. JSON-RPC Request Format**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "<method_name>",
  "params": [...],
  "id": 1
}
```

---

**4. Common Methods**

| Method                     | Description                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `eth_blockNumber`          | Returns the latest block number      |
| `eth_getBlockByNumber`     | Gets block details by number         |
| `eth_getTransactionByHash` | Retrieves transaction by hash        |
| `eth_getBalance`           | Returns wallet balance               |
| `eth_sendRawTransaction`   | Broadcasts a signed transaction      |
| `eth_call`                 | Executes a read-only contract method |
| `eth_estimateGas`          | Estimates gas usage                  |

---

**5. Example RPC Request (cURL)**

```bash
curl -X POST https://rpc.testnet.synergy-network.io \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}'
```

---

**6. WebSocket Usage**

Open a connection and subscribe to events:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "method": "eth_subscribe",
  "params": ["newHeads"]
}
```

Common subscriptions:

* `newHeads`: Block headers
* `logs`: Contract events (filterable by address or topic)
* `syncing`: Sync progress

---

**7. Filtering Events**

```json
{
  "method": "eth_subscribe",
  "params": [
    "logs",
    {
      "address": "0xContractAddress",
      "topics": ["0xTopicHash"]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

**8. Error Response Example**

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "error": {
    "code": -32000,
    "message": "insufficient funds"
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

---

**9. Developer Notes**

* All methods are Ethereum-compatible (EVM subset)
* Batch requests supported
* PQC transaction formats are handled at signature layer
* WebSocket connections are limited to 100 subscriptions per session

---

**10. Conclusion**

The Synergy RPC and WebSocket APIs give developers real-time, secure access to the blockchain network using familiar Ethereum interfaces. Theyâ€™re ideal for building wallets, explorers, analytics dashboards, or contract integrations across Synergy dApps and third-party systems.
