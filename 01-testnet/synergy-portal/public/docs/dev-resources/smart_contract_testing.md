## Smart Contract Testing Report

### 1. Overview

This report documents the testing procedures and results for the core Synergy Network smart contracts, including those related to token transfers, staking, governance, and cross-chain bridge operations. The objective is to verify functional correctness, gas efficiency, and security resilience.

---

### 2. Scope of Testing

* SYN Token Contract (ERC-20 compliant with extensions)
* Staking Contract (PoSy-specific logic)
* Governance Contracts (DAO.sol, Voting.sol, ProposalHandler.sol)
* Bridge Contracts (ETH and SOL bridge logic)

---

### 3. Test Environments

* Frameworks: Hardhat, Foundry, Truffle
* Networks: Local Hardhat node, Synergy Testnet
* Tooling: Ethers.js, Ganache CLI, Slither, Echidna, MythX

### 5. Testing Procedures

#### 5.1 Unit Testing

* Validate input/output behavior of contract methods.
* Ensure events are emitted correctly.
* Verify boundary and edge cases.

#### 5.2 Integration Testing

* Simulate multi-contract workflows: staking → proposal → voting → execution.
* Bridge tokens between ETH and SOL networks.
* Stress scenarios: 1000+ transactions in rapid succession.

#### 5.3 Fuzz Testing

* Used Echidna to generate randomized input payloads.
* No critical assertion failures recorded.

#### 5.4 Static Analysis

* Run Slither and MythX for vulnerabilities.
* Warnings reviewed manually.
* All high/medium risks resolved prior to deployment.

#### 5.5 Gas Usage Analysis

* Run with Hardhat gas profiler.
* Top consuming function: `stakeAndClaim()`
* Most optimized: `delegateVote()` with inlined logic.

### 6. Findings

| Severity | Description                             | Resolution                        |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| High     | None                                    | N/A                               |
| Medium   | Redundant modifier in `Bridge.sol`      | Removed for efficiency            |
| Low      | Unused `emit DebugEvent()` in `DAO.sol` | Commented for future testing only |

---

### 7. Recommendations

* Periodic re-testing on Mainnet post-deployment.
* Maintain automated regression tests in CI/CD.
* Integrate real-time gas tracking via Explorer backend.

---

### 8. Audit Readiness

* All contracts linted and verified on Synergy Testnet.
* Ready for external audit (next phase).
* Audit firm shortlist: Trail of Bits, Hacken, Quantstamp
