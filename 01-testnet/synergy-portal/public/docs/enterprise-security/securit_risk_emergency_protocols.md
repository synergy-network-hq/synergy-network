## Security Risk Assessment & Emergency Protocols

### 1. Overview

This document assesses potential security threats to the Synergy Network and outlines emergency response protocols for incidents affecting validator integrity, governance manipulation, smart contract vulnerabilities, and network-level attacks.

---

### 2. Threat Model Categories

* **Sybil Attacks**
* **DDoS Attacks**
* **Smart Contract Exploits**
* **Bridge Manipulation or Cross-Chain Faults**
* **Governance Takeover**
* **Validator Collusion or Downtime**
* **Data Corruption or Inconsistent Chain State**

### 3. Risk Classification Table

| Risk Type        | Severity | Detection Tool               | Mitigation Strategy                  |
| ---------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Sybil Attack     | High     | Synergy Score Thresholds     | Stake gate + PQC ID + clustering     |
| Contract Exploit | Critical | Audit + Runtime Monitors     | Upgradeable proxy + freeze switches  |
| Bridge Fault     | Critical | Signature Mismatch Detector  | Threshold signature enforcement      |
| DDoS             | Medium   | Node sync lag + rate spikes  | Rate limiting + dynamic node routing |
| Governance Spam  | Medium   | Proposal monitor             | Submission rate limiter + cooldown   |
| Validator Abuse  | High     | Audit Logs + Heartbeat Watch | Slash + remove from cluster          |

### 4. Emergency Response Mechanisms

#### 4.1 Multi-Signature Emergency Stop

* Controlled by: 3-of-5 emergency council (DAO elected)
* Can pause:

  * DAO voting
  * Contract execution
  * Bridge transactions

#### 4.2 Snapshot Rollback

* On-chain `rollbackTo(snapshotID)` admin function
* Must be approved via DAO proposal + auditor consensus

#### 4.3 Governance Freeze

* Triggered via anomaly detection or DAO council vote (75%)
* Freezes voting, proposal submissions, and treasury withdrawals

#### 4.4 Validator Hard Fork Trigger

* Requires 2/3 validator signature threshold
* Initiates protocol update or rollback

---

### 5. Security Monitoring Infrastructure

* Dashboard: `https://monitor.synergy-network.io/security`
* Real-time logs via Loki + Promtail
* Signature and hash anomaly tracking
* Governance pattern analyzer (bot voting, spam)

---

### 6. Recovery Flow

1. Detect anomaly or incident trigger
2. Quarantine and freeze affected modules
3. Notify validators + governance members
4. Execute emergency rollback or hotfix
5. Run post-mortem DAO audit report
6. Apply patches and re-enable systems via vote

---

### 7. Communication Plan

* Primary Alert Channels:

  * `@security-alerts` Discord channel
  * Validator email notification
  * On-chain bulletin contract

* Status page:

  * `https://status.synergy-network.io`

---

### 8. Compliance

* Aligns with:

  * GDPR: Right to be informed
  * AML/KYC: Bridge + treasury KYC for large withdrawals
  * SEC: Transparent response procedures

---

### 9. Future Enhancements

* DAO-controlled panic button on mobile app
* Real-time validator kill switch via biometric multi-auth
* AI anomaly detector for validator logs
