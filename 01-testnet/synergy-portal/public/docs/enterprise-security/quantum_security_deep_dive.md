## Quantum Security Implementation Deep Dive

### 1. Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of Synergy Network’s implementation of quantum-safe cryptography. It covers key standards adopted, algorithm selection, key management, and how post-quantum cryptography (PQC) integrates with wallet, validator, and bridge security.

---

### 2. Quantum Threat Model

* Adversaries with access to Shor’s algorithm-capable quantum computers
* Risk of retroactive key recovery on classical ECDSA-based blockchains
* Specific targets:

  * Wallet keys
  * Bridge validators
  * Governance signature sets

---

### 3. Chosen PQC Algorithms

| Algorithm       | Purpose                    | Standard        |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Dilithium-3** | Digital Signatures         | NIST Round 3    |
| **Kyber-768**   | Hybrid Key Exchange        | NIST Round 3    |
| **FROST+PQ**    | Threshold Signature Scheme | FROST+Dilithium |

---

### 4. Wallet Security

* Default wallet keypair: Dilithium-3
* Optional hybrid mode: ECDSA + Dilithium
* Backup/recovery via BIP-39-compatible seed
* All private keys stored with AES-256-GCM encryption

#### Example:

```json
{
  "publicKey": "dilithium-pk-abc...",
  "signature": "sig-dilithium-xyz...",
  "network": "synergy-testnet"
}
```

---

### 5. Validator Node Cryptography

* Validator signatures: Dilithium only
* Consensus voting (cluster votes): FROST threshold signatures
* Validator rekey rotation every 10 epochs (mandatory)

---

### 6. Bridge Node Cryptography

* Cross-chain messages signed via FROST+Dilithium
* Threshold: 5-of-7 for asset releases
* Public key proofs embedded in bridge tx metadata

---

### 7. Smart Contracts & PQC

* Synergy does not support smart contract execution of PQC natively
* Contracts verify PQC signatures off-chain and assert results
* ZK + PQC integration (planned via STARK verifier adapter)

---

### 8. Key Management Protocol (KMP)

* Hardware Security Module (HSM) compatibility
* PQ keys generated using entropy from `/dev/random` + user seed
* Key material sharded across cold + hot backup locations
* Multisig wallets require hybrid signature bundles

---

### 9. CLI Integration

```bash
# Generate PQ wallet
synergy-cli wallet create --pqc --label "QuantumSecure"

# Sign message with Dilithium
synergy-cli sign --algo dilithium --message "hello"
```

---

### 10. Audit & Benchmarking

* Benchmarks:

  * Dilithium Sign: \~2.3ms
  * Verify: \~0.8ms
  * Kyber Hybrid Exchange: <4ms per session

* PQ security audit partners:

  * PQShield (consulted)
  * Quarkslab (audit scheduled Q3 2025)

---

### 11. Governance & Future Upgrades

* PQC algorithm upgrades via DAO vote
* Pluggable PQ backend (supports new algorithms as they become standardized)
* Upgrade registry stored on-chain via SNS extensions
