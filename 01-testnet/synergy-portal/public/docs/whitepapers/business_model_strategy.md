### 2. Core Revenue Streams

#### 2.1 Transaction Fees

* **Standard Transactions:** Flat SYN fee for peer-to-peer operations
* **Smart Contract Execution:** Dynamic gas costs based on computation and storage
* **Cross-Chain Transfers:** Bridge usage fees based on asset type and network congestion

#### 2.2 Validator Staking

* **Delegated Proof-of-Synergy (PoSy):** Users stake SYN with validators
* **Rewards Pool:** Incentivizes uptime, governance participation, and cluster efficiency

#### 2.3 Ecosystem Services

* **SNS Name Registration:** One-time and renewal fees for domain names
* **UMA Integration:** Fees for resolving cross-chain addresses
* **Task Market Commission:** % fee on fulfilled decentralized computational tasks

#### 2.4 Enterprise & API Monetization
