## Governance DAO Constitution: Synergy Network

### 1. Preamble

This Constitution defines the rules, principles, and structure of the Synergy Network's decentralized governance system. It ensures all decisions are made transparently, collaboratively, and with the active participation of token holders, validators, and ecosystem contributors.

---

### 2. Governance Principles

* **Decentralization:** No single entity has unilateral control.
* **Transparency:** All decisions, funds, and votes are visible on-chain.
* **Merit-Based Voting:** Influence is weighted by Synergy Score, not just token holdings.
* **Quadratic Voting:** Balances the interests of large and small stakeholders.
* **Security:** Governance execution is handled through auditable smart contracts.

---

### 3. Voting Weight Formula

#### 3.1 Synergy Score-Based Voting

* Synergy Score (SS) is derived from:

  * Staked SYN
  * Validator participation
  * Proposal history
  * Community contribution

#### 3.2 Quadratic Voting Modifier

* Vote strength: $\sqrt{Staked\_SYN \times SS}$
* Prevents plutocracy while rewarding active members

### 4. Proposal Lifecycle

| Stage                 | Requirement / Duration                                      |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Proposal Submission   | Requires minimum Synergy Score threshold (configurable)     |
| Community Endorsement | ≥ 5% DAO members must endorse proposal                      |
| Voting Phase          | 7-day period with on-chain quadratic voting                 |
| Execution             | If approved, automatically executed by smart contract       |
| Post-Implementation   | 14-day review for performance, disputes, or rollback alerts |

---

### 5. Governance Structure

#### 5.1 Governance Roles

* **Synergy DAO Council:** Oversees strategic upgrades and treasury policy
* **Validator Clusters:** Submit optimization proposals and monitor implementations
* **Community Proposers:** Any token holder with minimum SS can propose
* **Governance Auditors:** Elected group to ensure rule compliance and flag violations

#### 5.2 Voting Distribution

| Role                  | Voting Influence     |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| DAO Council           | 40%                  |
| Validator Clusters    | 30% (weighted by SS) |
| General Token Holders | 20% (quadratic)      |
| Governance Auditors   | 10% (oversight)      |

---

### 6. Enforcement and Auditing

* **On-Chain Execution:** Smart contracts execute approved proposals
* **Governance Auditors:** Submit violation reports, propose sanctions, or initiate audits
* **Treasury Access:** Only allowed via approved DAO proposals
* **Penalty Escalation:** Slashing of Synergy Score and temporary voting bans

---

### 7. Emergency Protocols

* **Emergency Freeze Vote:** DAO Council + ≥75% of validators to temporarily halt governance
* **Community Referendum:** Triggered if ≥10% token holders initiate a critical vote
* **Rollback Policy Activation:** Refer to Emergency Governance Rollback document

---

### 8. Amendments

* Constitution amendments require:

  * ≥75% approval in DAO vote
  * ≥50% quorum of active governance participants
  * Public announcement and delay period (7 days) before activation

---

### 9. Conclusion

The Synergy DAO Constitution creates a balanced, adaptable, and transparent governance model. Through Synergy Score weighting, validator collaboration, and community participation, Synergy Network ensures sustainable and equitable decision-making that aligns with its mission of cooperative blockchain evolution.
