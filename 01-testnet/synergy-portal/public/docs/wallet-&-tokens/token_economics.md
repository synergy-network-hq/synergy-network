**1. Overview**

The Synergy Token (SYN) is the native utility token of the Synergy Network, powering everything from transactions and smart contracts to staking, governance, and reward mechanisms. This document outlines SYN’s supply structure, token utility, distribution plan, inflation/deflation mechanics, and long-term economic strategy.

**4. Supply Distribution**

| Category                | Allocation (%) | Tokens        | Vesting Schedule              |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Validator Rewards       | 30%            | 3,600,000,000 | Emitted gradually over 10 yrs |
| Ecosystem Development   | 25%            | 3,000,000,000 | DAO-controlled treasury       |
| Community & Airdrops    | 10%            | 1,200,000,000 | Various campaign releases     |
| Team & Founding Members | 10%            | 1,200,000,000 | 4-year vesting, 6-mo cliff    |
| Pre-Sale & Public Sale  | 15%            | 1,800,000,000 | Structured sale stages        |
| Reserve & Emergency     | 10%            | 1,200,000,000 | Multi-sig treasury lock       |

**5. Inflation and Deflation Mechanics**

* **Staking Inflation**: Validator and delegator rewards introduce mild inflation (\~2–5% yearly)
* **Deflationary Measures**:

  * % of transaction fees are burned (dynamic burn rate)
  * Penalties/slashing remove SYN from supply
  * Expired SNS/UMA names unclaimed within grace period are subject to token burn

---

**6. Economic Alignment Mechanisms**

* **Synergy Points Integration**: Rewards are weighted by contribution score
* **Governance Voting Boosts**: High SP scores magnify governance influence
* **Long-Term Holding Incentives**: Lockups for early supporters grant bonus multipliers

---

**7. DAO Treasury Role**

* Manages 25% ecosystem fund
* Funds are disbursed via community proposal and Synergy Score voting
* Treasury is audited and monitored on-chain
* Can adjust burn rates, inflation caps, and staking rewards through governance

---

**8. Pre-Sale Mechanics (Summary)**

* 15 sale stages, each with fixed allocation and price
* Early stages offer highest discount and longest vesting
* Unsold tokens roll into DAO treasury

---

**9. Token Utility Outlook**

* Expansion into:

  * Real-world utility payments
  * In-game and metaverse integrations
  * Governance across interoperable bridge chains

---

**10. Conclusion**

SYN tokenomics is designed to promote long-term sustainability, fair participation, and decentralized governance. Through thoughtful distribution, rewards-based inflation, and dynamic deflation, SYN remains a powerful driver of Synergy Network’s cooperative economy.
